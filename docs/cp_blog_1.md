# Introduction and our first problem

## Basic Setup

My basic setup is heavily inspired by [Brent Yorgey](). First have a
look at [this
blog](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2019/04/24/competitive-programming-in-haskell-basic-setup/)
for the basic template we’ll be using.

``` haskell
import Control.Arrow -- for >>>

main :: IO ()
main = interact $ _ 
```

There are also a few basic problems at the end of the above blog. I
recommend you first try to solve them before attempting the problem that
I am presenting.

## Literate Haskell

This entire blog post is a haskell file\! You can find the link at the
bottom, named *literate haskell source*. You can download the file and
run it directy using `runhaskell`.

## Problem:

Here’s the first problem I’ll be discussing: [Money
Sums](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1745/) from
[cses.fi](https://cses.fi/).

It is a very standard knapsack problem, but try to solve it using
haskell. I’ll post the solution next Friday which is 6th November,
2020.  
Feel free to discuss in the disqus comments at the end of this page.

CPHaskell
=========
A collection of templates for (some) common Algorithms and Data Structures used in Competitive Programming.  
And some (attempted) solutions to problems and contests from online judges.

I'm always open to suggestions to improve my code! Feel free to drop me a message, or add an issue/PR.
